**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**

* We were supposed to write a program that would calculate and list the sums of a certain amount of dice rolls, as well as practice with lists, functions, loops, and random numbers. 

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

* First we talked a lot, conceptualizing the issue at hand. Then we worked on the algorithm, completed the flowchart, and lastly created and tested the code.

**What were the Key concepts explored?**

* Lists, Pair programming, Loops, Functions

**Did your results match what you expected to get?**

* Yes. The code lists the sums of dice in both a graph and list format.

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**

* Yes. The program does not let the user enter a negative number or a non-digit input, instead it re-prompts them to enter a valid input.

**What challenges did you encounter?**

* I struggled with creation of the flow chart. I wasn't sure how to show the different functions.

**Did you overcome them, and how?**

* I colored each function on the flow chart a different color, while still keeping the entire chart continuous.

**Any key takeaways?**

* Planning the code through your algorithm is extremely important.

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**

* Yes I do. I feel like I better understand lists and functions. 

**What was it like working with your partner?**

* It was really great! She is very nice and hardworking.
