One challenge was ensuring that the sums were properly counted and displayed in a user-friendly format. 
Another challenge was understanding how to track the rolls. 
To help me overcome the problems, I first broke down the problem into smaller partsâ€”rolling the dice, 
counting the sums, and displaying the results. Also, my partner and I outlined the steps in the algorithm 
before writing any code, which helped me structure the program logically. Additionally, we tested individual 
components (like rolling the dice and counting the sums) before integrating everything into the main function.
One key takeaway was the importance of understanding how much you can do when you know how to manipulate strings and lists.
Yes, I believe I successfully learned how to simulate a random dice-rolling process, count occurrences of dice sums,
and display the results in a chart format.
Working with my partner was really amazing. I learned a lot from her in terms of learning how to design 
solutions to problem.  We discussed the logic behind dice roll distributions and helped each other solve 
any issues that arose. Working with my partner was an extremely rewarding experience.
